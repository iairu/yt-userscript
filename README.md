# Show Channel-Only YouTube Side Recommendations without Shorts

![Preview of YouTube user script side recommendations improvement](preview.jpg)

## Why This Exists

YouTube seems to have evolved from a community platform into an engagement-driven machine, leading to:

- Presence of clickbait [1.1] [1.2], over-optimization [2] and interest in algorithmic manipulation [3]
- Mental health implications from infinite scroll [4] (in this case also "infinite watch more")
- Reduced feeling of purpose or enjoyment on a personal level
- Creator burnout [5]

## What This Script Does

- Shows only channel names in recommendations
- Removes thumbnails, view counts, and clickbait
- Maintains core YouTube functionality
- Zero data collection, purely CSS modifications
- Works with Tampermonkey

## Benefits for the user

- Mindful viewing experience
- Reduced FOMO and anxiety
- Better content discovery
- Support for quality creators
- Time management

## Installation

1. Install Tampermonkey from official browser stores
2. Install scripts from Greasy Fork [submissions in progress] or from this GitHub repository
3. Visit YouTube and enjoy distraction-free browsing on video pages (homepage is left untouched)
